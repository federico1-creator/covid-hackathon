- CNN --> Resnet34 pretrain on Imagenet
- train on more data from internet (Kaggle)
- data augmentation to increase the quantity of data (flip, rotation)
- SVM, LR, DT
- decide the flow of the Loss inside the architecture

Two possible approaches:

1. Images on the CNN and consider the output as a classificator with the prob.
Take the clinical data as input of the second part with also the output of the CNN.

2. Consider separately the 2 data types and merge in a MLP final classificator.

### Their work:
Images and clinical data were analyzed using 3 machine learning methods and radiomics: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and decision trees (DT). Model were validated with 10-fold and center-wise cross-validation. Our AI-based algorithms showed 74%, 75%, 65% and 73%, 75%, 60% accuracy with 10-fold and center-wise cross validation respectively.
